1. Performance & Optimization Tools
    Query Performance Analyzer (Explain Plan):
    Feature: Add an "Explain" button next to "Run Query".
    Function: Visually displays how MongoDB executes a query (e.g., COLLSCAN vs. IXSCAN). It highlights if an index was used or if the query scanned thousands of documents to find just one result.
    Why: Critical for developers to optimize backend speed.
    Index Management Dashboard:
    Feature: A dedicated tab for each collection showing existing indexes.
    Function: Allow users to create compound, text, or TTL (Time-To-Live) indexes directly via a UI form rather than writing command-line code.
    Why: Indexes are the #1 way to fix slow databases.

2. Advanced Data Visualization
    Aggregation Pipeline Builder:
    Feature: A drag-and-drop or stage-by-stage builder for complex aggregations ($match -> $group -> $project).
    Function: Users add stages individually, and the tool shows a preview of the data at each stage.
    Why: Writing raw aggregation JSON arrays is error-prone and difficult to debug.
    Relationship Visualizer (Manual Refs):
    Feature: Detect fields ending in _id or Id and treat them as "Foreign Keys".
    Function: If a user clicks on a userId field in an Orders collection, it instantly navigates to that specific user document in the Users collection.
    Why: Bridges the gap between SQL relational thinking and MongoDB's document model.

3. Security & Connectivity
    SSH Tunneling (Port Forwarding):
    Feature: Add an "Advanced" tab in the connection bar.
    Function: Allow users to connect to production databases hidden behind firewalls by routing traffic through an SSH bastion host (requires SSH Host, User, and Key file).
    Why: Essential for almost all professional/production environments.
    Connection Color Coding:
    Feature: User assigns a color (Red, Green, Blue) to a connection.
    Function: When connected to "Production" (Red), the entire window border or tab turns red.
    Why: Prevents accidental deletion of data in the wrong database.

4. Data Integrity & Management
    JSON Schema Validator:
    Feature: A UI to define strict rules for a collection (e.g., "email must be a string", "age must be > 18").
    Function: Before inserting or updating, the tool checks if the data violates these rules and warns the user.
    Why: MongoDB is schemaless by default, but apps often need structure.
    Import from Clipboard:
    Feature: A "Paste as Docs" button.
    Function: Detects if the clipboard contains JSON or CSV data and immediately opens the Import preview dialog without needing to save a file first.
    Why: speeds up ad-hoc data testing.

5. Developer Quality of Life
    Query History & Bookmarks:
    Feature: A sidebar widget showing the last 50 successful queries.
    Function: Users can "Star" specific complex queries to save them as named bookmarks (e.g., "Monthly Active Users").
    Why: Saves typing repetitive complex filters.
    Server Status Dashboard:
    Feature: A graphical dashboard (using db.serverStatus()).
    Function: Displays real-time charts for Operations/sec, active connections, and memory usage.
    Why: Provides a quick health check of the database server.

6. Visual Aggregation Builder
    The Problem: In SQL, you use GROUP BY and JOIN. In MongoDB, you use the Aggregation Framework, which involves writing a complex array of pipeline stages ($match, $group, $lookup, $project) that can get very long and hard to debug. The Feature:
        Create a "Pipeline Builder" tab where users can add stages one by one.
        Visual: Users select "Group" from a dropdown, and you show inputs for "Group Key" and "Accumulators" (Sum, Avg).
        Preview: Show a live preview of the data after each stage (e.g., show the data after the filter, then show it after the grouping).
        Why it helps: It turns a complex coding task into a step-by-step visual process.

7. Schema Analyzer (The "Structure Finder")
    The Problem: MongoDB is "schemaless," meaning one document can have an email field and the next one might not. This is a nightmare for developers who expect consistency. The Feature:
        A tool that scans a random sample of 1,000 documents in a collection.
        Output: It generates a report saying:
            "Field email exists in 100% of documents."
            "Field phone exists in only 40% of documents."
            "Field age is a String in 50% of docs and an Integer in 50% (Data Type Mismatch Warning)."
    Why it helps: It gives you the confidence of knowing your data's structure without enforcing a strict schema.

8. Server Health Dashboard
    The Problem: When the database is slow, you need to know why (CPU? RAM? Too many connections?). The Feature:
    A "Dashboard" tab that visualizes the output of the db.command("serverStatus") command.
    Widgets:
        Live Charts: Operations per second (Insert/Query/Update/Delete).
        Connections: Active vs. Available connections.
        Memory: Current RAM usage.
    Why it helps: It makes your tool feel like a professional administrative console (like MySQL Workbench).

9. GridFS File Manager
    The Problem: Storing large files (images, PDFs) in MongoDB requires a specification called GridFS, which splits files into chunks. You cannot view these like normal documents. The Feature:
        A dedicated "File Explorer" interface for GridFS buckets (fs.files and fs.chunks).
        Capabilities: Allow users to upload a file (which your code splits and stores) and download/preview stored files.
        Why it helps: Many developers avoid GridFS because it's hard to inspect. A GUI for it is a standout feature.
